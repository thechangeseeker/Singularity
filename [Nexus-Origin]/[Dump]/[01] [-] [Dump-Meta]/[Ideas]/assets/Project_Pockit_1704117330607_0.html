 the enthusiastic response from followers worldwide since spring, I have
 spent much time on meetings with various companies to get quotes and 
organize production options for Pockit, as well as contacting several 
component suppliers to confirm about stock + lead-times.<br><br>Also 
made formal reservation requests for some important components that have
 been in short supply due to the pandemic. Making frequent modifications
 to the board designs based on component availability has been 
exhausting (presumably even for consumer-device manufacturers), so this 
being resolved will be a huge relief.<br><br>In parallel, I've wrapped 
up the design and implementation of several new Blocks and apps, many of
 which are based on requests from community members, emails, etc. In the
 coming months, I hope to design a visual database of all Pockit Blocks

 as much as I like the idea of infinitely chainable electronic bricks, 
the overall concept of the last few months has some discouraging flaws.<br><br>Such
 a series of modules (with multiple dynamic SPI slaves) has made the 
bus-communication a lot harder to code and higher-latency than I 
expected; plus, there is excessive signal length for even a simple 
assembly. But most importantly, the 1-male 3-female USB connector setup 
takes up too much space, making each module big and heavy.<br><br>Maybe 
time to return to the drawing board. My goal with this modular project 
has always been to make not just a flexible but also <i>compact</i> 
solution. It's certainly not ideal to carry around a train of large 
blocks (with questionable signal integrity); it's nowhere as condensed 
or reliable of a properly designed gadget's printed circuit-board (PCB).<br><br>So
 yesterday, I began thinking asymptotically: What is the closest I can 
get to emulating a compact PCB, but with easily attachable+arrangeable
